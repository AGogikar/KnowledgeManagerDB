# KnowledgeManagerDB
The primary objective is to develop a C++ library that connects the llama.cpp embedding generator with a FAISS-based vector database. This library will allow for efficient storage and retrieval of significant files in a database, and support retrieval-augmented generation using the LLM (Large Language Models).
